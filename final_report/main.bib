	Abstract = {There is an increasing demand for indoor positioning systems as location
based services are becoming more and more widespread.  However,  this
field of research has not yet achieved the same success as that of outdoor
positioning.   The  objective  of  this  project  was  to  implement  an  indoor
positioning  system  relying  on  Bluetooth  technology,  and  to  integrate  it
into the Global Positioning Module (GPM) developed at the Institute of
Services Science at the University of Geneva.  The system compares the
signal strengths of surrounding Bluetooth devices to a database of mea-
surements  taken  across  the  indoor  area,  in  order  to  estimate  the  user’s
position.  Through an evaluation of the system, an accuracy of approxi-
mately 1.5 meters has been obtained.},
