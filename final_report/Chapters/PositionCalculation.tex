% Position Calculation

\chapter{Position Calculation} % Main chapter title

\label{PositionCalculation}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Overview}
Talk about the goal of this section: to calculate positions of objects given the ranges between them. Talk about how Arduinos and Androids are connected by FTDI.

\section{High-Level Example in 2D}
Maybe this?

\section{Extending This to 3D}
Do the math on how we actually calculate things here.

\section{Arbitrariness (pick a better title later)}
The positions calculated from ranges do not correspond to the real world! We must use the cellphones' accelerometer (for gravity) and magnetic sensor (for compass direction/inclination) to map these positions to reality.

Go over how this is done.

\section{Getting the Ranges}
Talk about FTDI and our protocol to communicate from Arduino to Android. Go over how they are parsed (put in appendix of parsing code)

\section{Conclusion}
This subsystem calculates positions; we figured out how ranges are obtained, how they are calculated. Go over this in more detail.
