%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter covers the position calculation subsystem, which takes the ranges from the rangefinding subsystem and calculates their positions. It also covers how the subsystem is integrated into the augmented reality subsystem. The position subsystem is not a separate piece of hardware. Rather, it is just a very complex mathematical function. An example of possible positions calculated from range data is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FrameOfReference}.

The topics covered in this chapter are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The infinite possible positions able to be calculated from a set of ranges.
	\item An example of calculating the positions of anchors with basic trigonometry in 2D.
	\item How this is extended to 3D.
	\item The protocol used by the Arduinos to communicate with the cell phones of the users and transfer the ranging data.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Frame of Reference}
\label{FrameOfReference}

One of the most important aspects to understanding the position of an object in space is knowing what it is \emph{relative} to. If a point $p = (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3)$, this is not useful unless it is known where, say, $(0, 0, 0)$ is and what directions the various axes point in.

The rangefinding subsystem determines the ranges between various devices. With these ranges, trigonometry can be used to determine positions in 3D space. However, it is impossible to place the positions in such a way that they correspond to the real world with only the range information. There are many different possible sets of positions which will result in the same rangefinding data. Figure~\ref{fig:FrameOfReference} shows two possible sets of positions that will result in the rangefinding system reporting the same ranges.

In order to cut down on the infinite possible solutions to finding positions given only range data, this subsystem must arbitrarily create its own system of coordinates. The positions calculated by this subsystem must be further transformed so as to correspond to the real world. This transformation is not covered in this chapter, and instead is dealt with in Section~\ref{Calibration}.

\section{Starting in 2D}
\label{HighLevelExample}

\end{figure}

As 3D position calculation is much more complex, position calculation is done in 2D will be explained first. The distances between three anchors, $a_{0}$, $ a_{1}$  and $a_{2}$ are obtained first. The distance between anchor $i$ and anchor $j$ is $d_{ij}$. This network is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PositionCalculationNetwork}.

In order to assign positions in 2D space to the anchors that keep them the same ranges from each other, $a_{0}$ is set arbitrarily to be at the origin. Next, $a_{1}$ is arbitrarily decided to be on the x-axis, which puts it at the position $(0, d_{01})$. With these two positions, the angle $\Theta$ between the x-axis and the vector from $a_0$ to $a_2$ can be calculated with the cosine law:

\[ \Theta = \cos ^{-1}\Big(\frac{d_{01}^2 + d_{02}^2 - d_{12}^2 }{2 d_{01} d_{02}}\Big)\]

With $\Theta$, we can calculate x and y coordinates of $a_2$:

\[ x = cos(\Theta) d_{12} \]
\[ y = sin(\Theta) d_{12} \]

\section{3D Position Calculation}
Extending the subsystem to three dimensions starts the same way as in two dimensions, though four anchors are required to get a reliable position in 3D. We have our four anchors: $a_{0}$, $a_{1}$ , $a_{2}$ and $a_{3}$. 

To begin, the same steps are followed as detailed in Section~\ref{HighLevelExample}, but the z-coordinate of every point is set to 0. That is, the origin is arbitrarily determined to be the position of $a_{0}$. $a_{1}$ is arbitrarily determined to be on the x-axis and placed at $(0, d_{01}, 0)$, where $d_{01}$ is the distance between $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$. The cosine law is then used to determine the position of $a_{2}$.

The calculation of the position of the fourth anchor comes last. As the other three anchors have been declared as being on the xy-axis, the fourth anchor must contain a z-component.

To begin with, we calculate the $(x, y)$ position of the fourth anchor as if it were on the xy-plane - though only temporarily.

\[ \Theta = \cos ^{ - 1}\Big(\frac{d_{01}^2 + d_{03}^2 - d_{13}^2 }{2 d_{01} d_{03}}\Big)\]

\[ x_{temp} = cos(\Theta) d_{13} \]
\[ y_{temp} = sin(\Theta) d_{13} \]
\[ z_{temp} = 0 \]

This temporary point is the correct distance from all the anchors except $a_3$. In order to determine a position that is the correct distance away from $a_2$ but still the same distance away from $a_0$ and $a_1$, the temporary point is rotated around the x-axis. Because the first two anchors are on the x-axis, this keeps their distance to $a_3$ constant.

This rotation forms a circle around the x-axis of a radius equal to $y_{temp}$. We will rotate our temporary point to a position where its distance from $a_2$ is equal to $d_{23}$.

We calculate the distance between the x value of the temporary point and the x value of anchor 2, we denote this value $\Delta x$.

\[ \Delta x = x_{temp} - x_{2} \]

Now that we have $\Delta x$ we can now calculate the position of our fourth anchor using trigonometry:

\[\Theta = \cos ^{ - 1}\Big(\frac {\Delta x^2 - d_{23}^2 + y_{2}^2 + y_{temp}^2}{2 y_{2} y_{temp}}\Big)\]

A proof for this equation can be found in Appendix~\ref{PositionCalculationProof}.

There are two possible values for $\Theta$, positive or negative. The decision affects whether our anchor has a positive or negative z-component. The positive z-component is chosen arbitrarily; the cell phone calibration process can flip the z-component later.

\[ x_{3} = x_{temp} \]
\[ y_{3} = cos(\Theta) y_{temp} \]
\[ z_{3} = sin(\Theta) y_{temp} \]

\section{Integrating Rangefinding and Position Calculation}
The position calculation code runs on the cellphone. In order to calculate positions, ranges must be transferred to the cellphone from the Arduino Pro Mini. 

The Arduino's processor can communicate serially via UART TTL. Most cellphones do not have the ability to communicate serially, but Future Technology Devices International (FTDI) manufactures a USB cable that interfaces between the serial output of the Arduino and the micro USB port of a cellphone. With this cable connecting an Arduino and a cellphone, the cellphone can provide power to the Arduino and send and receive data to it.

The project uses the Android \code{D2xx} library, provided by FTDI, to communicate with the Arduino while running an Android app. It allows the easy sending and receiving of bytes. 

\section{Protocol}
There are a number of design considerations when dealing with the communications between the cellphone and the Arduino:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The stream of data may begin in the middle of a message, as the buffer storing the serial data sent from the Arduino has only a limited capacity. If a cellphone were connected to an anchor that had already been running for some time, it is quite likely that the buffer would have overflowed. So, the protocol must include a way to determine the start of a message.
	\item The protocol should be human readable for easy debugging.
\end{enumerate}

With this in mind, a simple protocol was developed. Lines of text, delineated by newline characters, are sent. If the Arduino is reporting the range between two devices, it sends a line with the format:

\begin{center}
\code{!range <from ID> <to ID> <range in meters>}
\end{center}

If the Arduino is informing the cellphone of its id, it sends a line with the format:

\begin{center}
\code{!id <tag's ID>}
\end{center}


If the cellphone reads a line which does not start with `!', the line is assumed to either have started in the middle of a ranging information line, or else debug data has been sent. Either way, the line is discarded and the system waits to read a new line.

An example of the output from the Arduino is:

\code{\\
DW1000 initialized ... \\
Committed configuration ... \\
New device found. ID: 1 \\
Transmission received from tag 1 with transmission count 1 \\
!range 1 2 0.00 \\
Transmission received from tag 1 with transmission count 3 \\
!range 2 1 3.26 \\
!range 1 2 91659.28 \\
Transmission received from tag 1 with transmission count 5 \\
!range 2 1 3.48 \\
!range 1 2 3.38 \\
Transmission received from tag 1 with transmission count 7 \\
!range 2 1 3.37 \\
!range 1 2 3.42 \\
}

Note the briefly extremely large range while the timestamps settle.

Parsing is done on the cellphone with the \code{java.util.Scanner} class. The parsing code can be found in \code{TagParser.java} in the AR Code. See Appendix~\ref{SourceCode}.

\section{Summary}
This chapter covered the position calculation subsystem.

The issues with the infinite possible positions that can be calculated from a set of ranges between nodes were raised. Ultimately the positions calculated by this system must be calibrated by the cell phone to correspond to real world positions.

The math behind calculating positions in 3D given distances between nodes was discussed. The key to solving for the position of the fourth anchor is through making a circle around the x-axis and finding out where on the circle to place the fourth anchor so that the distance from it to anchor 3 matches.

Finally, the specifics of how the cellphones and Arduinos are interfaced were discussed. The Arduino, which holds the range information, is connected to the cell phone via a USB cable which translates the serial output of the Arduino into a stream of bytes for the cell phone to read and parse. Messages can be corrupted on occasion or be received halfway through, so each important message starts with a `!' character.
