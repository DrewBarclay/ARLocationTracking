The Introduction
can be made into its own chapter but no more than about 10\% of the space of the total report
should be allocated to introductory remarks. The Introduction is a good place to give a literature
review (i.e., if a literature review is not the main purpose of the report), put the subject matter into
context, and give the relevant motivation for the work which was performed. The remaining body
of the report should be broken up into chapters in a logical manner.
